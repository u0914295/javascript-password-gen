## Description
My motivation for building this web application was to create a password generator that not only was able to produce a randomized, strong password based on several parameters the employee could customize to their liking, but also create a polished UI that satisfied the business owner's wishes of having the application match the aesthetics of her cat café business empire. 

Cybersecurity has been a field of computer science that has had (and is predicted to continue to have) a significant increase in job growth rate within the United States. As technology becomes more and more implemented within the average American's everyday life, the need for ways to increase the security of electronic files has never been more important. Certain data in the wrong hands could cause catastrophic damages for everyone involved. This program helps add a small piece of increased security to the data that comprises the highly successful cat cafe empire. This application combined with additional measures of increased security would decrease the chance a cyberattack would be successful.

From building this application, I learned that there are certain, "official" guidelines that are highly recommended to follow when creating a password. I've seen password requirements my whole life whenever I would create an account somewhere. However, building this application really put into perspective how much of a "rat race" cybersecurity is. The parameters often asked of a user when defining a password were much less strict than today's. As cyber crime continues to advance, so will cybersecurity's need to combat the crime as well. 

## Installation
This web application can be installed by downloading the source code from this repository. Once downloaded, unzip the contents to a target destination of your choice. Upload this unzipped folder into a coding editing software (such as Virtual Code Studios). To do this, open VSCode and click on the "File" tab in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Once the code has been imported into VSCode, you can preview how the application would run by right-clicking on the "index.html" file and selecting "Open with Live Server". This will open a "demo" of sorts of the deployed application. 

To deploy the application yourself, one can use the GitHub pages feature. I have gone through the trouble of deploying the application myself, which the link/URL to it can be found in the upper right-hand corner of this repository (highlighted in blue inside the brief description portion) *OR* by clicking the deployed URL here: (https://u0914295.github.io/javascript-password-gen/)

## Usage
The following set of screenshots illustrates how to use the application. Once the deployed application has started, the following screen will appear:

To start setting customized conditions of the randomized password you want generated, click on the pink "&hearts;Generate Password&hearts;" button. Once done, the following prompt will appear, asking the user how long the user would like the password to be on a scale from 8-128 characters (in this example, I chose '10') - once determined, click "OK":

The next parameter prompt will ask the user if they would like the password to include uppercase letters or not. In this example screenshot, I entered "Yes" in the data field followed by clicking "OK":

Now, the application will ask the user if they would like to incorporate numbers/digits in their password. For this walkthrough example, I said "Yes" and clicked "OK":

Finally, the last prompt will now ask the user if they would like to incorporate "special characters" in their password. Every tye of special character that could possibly be apart of a generated password from use of this application are shown in a database created by the organization, "OWASP". For the sake of the user always, always, always wanting to create as strong of a password as possible for classified data files, I entered "Yes" once again in the data field and clicked the "OK" button. 


The application will now have generated a randomized password based on the parameters we specified! A screenshot of the password that was created is shown below:
